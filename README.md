# obesity_prediction_analysis

This project was developed to predict the obesity status of individuals based on various features. The project uses machine learning models such as **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, and **Logistic Regression** to predict obesity. In addition, **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** was applied to increase the accuracy of the model.

## Project Description

This project predicts the obesity status of individuals using their features such as **age**, **height**, **weight**, **family history of obesity**, **health habits**. Based on the predictions of the models, it is predicted whether individuals are **obese** or not. In addition, by using **PCA** in the project, the dimensions of high-dimensional data were reduced and the models were made to work more efficiently.

### Models Used:
- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Logistic Regression**

### Dimensionality Reduction:
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is used to increase the accuracy of the model.
